# Pipely™️

A single-purpose, single-tenant CDN for [changelog.com](https://changelog.com).
Runs [Varnish Cache](https://varnish-cache.org/releases/index.html) (open
source) on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/changelog). This repository exists for a
single reason: build the simplest CDN on [Fly.io](https://fly.io/changelog).
You are welcome to fork it and make it your own. OSS FTW 💚

## How it started

> I like the idea of having like this 20-line Varnish config that we deploy
> around the world, and it’s like “Look at our CDN, guys.”
>
> It’s so simple, and it can do exactly what we want it to do, and nothing
> more.
>
> But I understand that that’s a <strong>pipe dream</strong>, because that
> Varnish config will be slightly longer than 20 lines, and we’d run into all
> sorts of issues that we end up sinking all kinds of time into.

## Local development and testing

While it's fun watching other people experiment with digital resin (varnish
😂), it's a whole lot more fun when you can repeat those experiments yourself,
understand more how it works, and make your own modifications.

You can find some instructions and notes for kicking the tires and [developing
& testing this locally](docs/local_dev.md).

A few other commands that you may be interested in:

```bash
# Requires https://github.com/casey/just

Available recipes:
    report     # Open the test report
    test *ARGS # Run the tests

# Run the tests
just test

# There is a script which precedes `just`
# Yes, we should combine them. Contributions welcome!
./run
First argument must be one of the following
deploy          → deploys to Fly.io
world-scale     → makes it World Scale™
small-scale     → makes it Small Scale™
http-detailed   → shows detailed http response
http-measure    → measures http response times
http-profile    → profiles http responses
demo-2024-01-26 → runs through the first demo
demo-2024-06-21 → runs through the second demo

💡 All following arguments are passed to the command
```
